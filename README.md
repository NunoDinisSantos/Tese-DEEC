This is my dissertation for my Masters of Electrical and Computer engineering degree.

The objective is for students to do some exercise while playing a video game! While playing, students can earn credits which they can use to trade for meals, pens, and other small gifts.

Students are able to register with their student number (id) which will able them to have their own game progress.

The gameplay is purely by movement using MediaPipe, where we map player movements to gameplay movement. This is done by the python program.
