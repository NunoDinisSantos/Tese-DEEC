This is my dissertation for my Masters of Electrical and Computer engineering degree.

The objective is for students to do some exercise while playing a video game! While playing, students can earn credits which they can use to trade for meals, pens, and other small gifts.

Students are able to register with their student number (id) which will able them to have their own game progress.

The gameplay is purely by movement using MediaPipe, where we map player movements to gameplay movement. This is done by the python program.

For this project I am using Unity to create the game, docker to have my frontend, API and database setup in a server.


The game is a chill underwater game! There are several zones in which the player can only go when they have the unlocked modules! There is day and night, sometimes rain, cloudy or clear sky! Sometimes we get a little music as well :D

Here's a little gif!
